    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes! I ended up getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a little different from plain steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs, so I ended up throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe. This dish would be great with shrimp as well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Snow Crab clusters</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Clove Garlic</li>
        <li>Teaspoons</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit, length-wise, into the shell of each piece of crab.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add crab legs to the skillet; toss to coat with butter mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
